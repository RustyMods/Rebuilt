## üõ†Ô∏è Rebuilt

**Rebuilt** enhances the Valheim building experience by introducing a *ghost piece* system that streamlines reconstruction.

### üîÑ What It Does

- **Ghosting on Destruction**  
  When a structure or piece is destroyed, it doesn't vanish completely. Instead, it transforms into a *ghost* ‚Äî a semi-transparent version that preserves its original position and orientation.

- **Rebuilding with the Repair Hammer**  
  Use the standard repair hammer to *rebuild* ghost pieces instantly. If configured, rebuilding can require resources, maintaining balance with the base game.

- **Visual and Functional**  
  Ghost pieces use a special material with partial transparency, making them visually distinct. They also disable most active components (e.g., light, particles, fireplaces), preventing them from functioning until rebuilt.

- **Performance**  
  Ghosts retain only minimal functionality. Effects, support calculations, and interactions are disabled unless required, ensuring they don't burden the game world unnecessarily.

- **Configurations**  
  Plugin behavior‚Äîsuch as whether rebuilding costs resources, ward required or whether ghost pieces provide support‚Äîcan be customized.

- **Blacklist Compatible**  
  Automatically excludes ships and other user-defined prefabs via a blacklist.

### üß∞ Ideal Use Case

This plugin is perfect for builders who want a quick way to restore complex structures after attacks or environmental damage, without manually placing each piece again.
